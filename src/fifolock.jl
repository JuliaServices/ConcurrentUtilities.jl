    FIFOLock()

A reentrant lock similar to Base.ReentrantLock, but with strict FIFO ordering.

Base.ReentrantLock allows tasks to "barge the lock", i.e. it is occasionally
possible for a task to jump the queue of tasks waiting for the lock; this is
intentional behavior to increase throughput as described
[here](https://webkit.org/blog/6161/locking-in-webkit/).

When fairness is more important than throughput, use this FIFOLock.

# Correctness reasoning:
# 
# `havelock` can only be unset with the `cond_wait` lock held.
# Locking then first tries to set `havelock`; on failure, we
# acquire the `cond_wait` lock and try to set `havelock` again
# to ensure that we didn't coincide with an `unlock`. If we
# fail again, then we are assured that we will not miss an
# `unlock`, because we hold the `cond_wait` lock. Thus we can
# safely wait on `cond_wait`.
#
# FIFO ordering is ensured in `unlock`, which first acquires
# the `cond_wait` lock. If `cond_wait`'s wait queue is empty,
# the lock is released. Otherwise, we pop the first task in
# the wait queue, transfer ownership to it, schedule it, and
# return. Thus when one or more tasks are waiting,`havelock`
# is never reset.

"""
    lock(l::FIFOLock)

Acquire lock `l`. If the calling task has already acquired the lock
previously, increment an internal counter and return to support
reentrancy. Each `lock` call must be matched with an `unlock` call.

As with `Base.ReentrantLock`, acquiring a lock will inhibit running
finalizers on that thread until the lock is released.

FIFO behavior is handled in `unlock`.

"""
    unlock(l::FIFOLock)

Release ownership of the lock `l`. If the lock was acquired recursively,
the number of unlocks must match the number of locks before `l` is
actually released.

FIFO behavior is enforced here, in `unlock`: if one or more tasks are
waiting on the lock, we do not actually unlock; just hand ownership to
the first waiting task and schedule it.
